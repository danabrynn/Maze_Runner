# Maze Runner

Maze Runner randomly generates mazes of arbitrary size and lets users move through the maze to reach the end point. Maze solutions are also found and can be visualized.


## Algorithms
Mazes generated recursively using depth-first search or using Kruskal's algorithm. Maze solutions are found using depth-first search. Additional maze generation algorithms will be added in the future!
